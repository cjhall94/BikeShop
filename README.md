# BikeShop
Bicycle E-Commerce Site for Gusty Cooper
Implementation of website was accomplished by Colton Hall, Jason Raczkowski, and Corey Taylor.

Gusty's BikeShop is a website designed for our client, Gusty Cooper, that may potentially be used as a site for his business. The site contains pages and information that correspond to the client's intended requirements. Although the website may be functional, it is not entirely finished, and always subject to change.

For our purposes we ran the server created by the Cloud9 environment.
Before getting started to access the site some libraries need to be installed. 
Enter the following commands to install the libraries:
   sudo easy_install flask markdown
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2
   sudo easy_install flask-socketio
  
Once that is completed the server.py file can be run with no problems and the website can be accessed.
Any errors found or written code is always subject to change.
